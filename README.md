How I learn rust by trying implementing various things, in various industries to see where it shines and to decide if I want to work with rust or not.

I am and will be doing the following:

##### Data structures
- [ ] Re-implement vec (ref: [^1])

##### Graphics
- [ ] Experiment rendering in WebGPU (via wgpu, also my first time trying WebGPU) (ref: [^2])

##### Algorithms
- [ ] Image blob detection (ref: [^3])

More to come!

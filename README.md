How I learn rust by trying implementing various things, in various industries to
see where it shines and to decide if I want to work with rust or not.

I am and will be doing the following:

##### Software architect
-   `[In Progress]` **Plugin system** â€“ a system I originally designed in Go at work.
    It supports application lifecycle (on start, on destroy, etc., inspired by
    Unity) for each plugin and a callback driven event dispatcher.

##### Data structures
- `[Planned]` Re-implement vec (ref: [^1])

##### Graphics
- `[Planned]` Experiment rendering in WebGPU (via wgpu, also my first time trying WebGPU) (ref: [^2])

##### Algorithms
- `[Planned]` Re-implement image blob detection (ref: [^3])

More to come!
